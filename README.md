This application was developed to facilitate fuzzy comparisons of patristic texts based on analysis of sentence transformer cosine similarity metrics.

The methodology is to execute cosine similarity of a full cartesian product across all sentences in 2 corpuses.
The resulting pairs are then ordered by similarity score and clustered if appropriate.

The intermediate Jupyter Notebook has not been included here because of licensing restrictions on the data used.

I have posted a sample result document comparing the corpus of Augustine of Hippo and Gregory Palamas.
The appendix of this document will be expanded into a whitepaper in the future which will elaborate on the
analysis methodology.
